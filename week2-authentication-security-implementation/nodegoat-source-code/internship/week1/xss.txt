Title: Stored XSS via First Name field (NodeGoat - Week1)
Target URL: http://localhost:4000
Vulnerable endpoint/page: Signup (POST /signup) -> Profile view
Field: firstName
Payload used: <script>alert('XSS')</script>

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open http://localhost:4000/signup
2. Fill form:
   - User Name: xsstestuser
   - First Name: <script>alert('XSS')</script>
   - Last Name: tester
   - Password: TestPass123!
   - Verify Password: TestPass123!
   - Email: test+nodegoat@example.com
3. Submit form.
4. Observe an alert('XSS') popup when viewing profile — proves stored XSS.
Evidence:
- Screenshot: docs/screenshots/xss_alert.png (take and save this screenshot next)
- DevTools Response showing raw payload reflected in page (you already captured this)
Impact:
- An attacker could store arbitrary JS in a user's profile and execute it in other users' browsers (session theft, CSRF, defacement, etc.)

Suggested remediation:
- Sanitize / encode user-provided input before rendering (HTML-encode on output).
- Validate & restrict allowed characters for name fields (e.g., letters, spaces only).
- Use Content-Security-Policy (CSP) to mitigate script execution.
- Implement proper output encoding libraries or template escaping.
